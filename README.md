# adbXng.py
Python based automation for animal crossing pocket camp using adb

Mostly for learning python, also for developing a simple adb python shim.

Unfortunatley for now Allot of the work is usng pixel positioning based on a phone with a 1080*1920 res

Going forward i plan on adding image recognitions methods to find things without using pixel positions (but not yet)
